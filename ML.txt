Defining a model - my_model = Modelname()
Training a model - my_model.fit(features, target)
Making Prediction - my_model.predict(data)

How many rows and columns in a data? - data.shape
What are the names of my variables (columns) - data.columns
What do first few rows of database contains? - data.head()
are there missing values in my dataframe?  - data.isnull().sum()
what are the summary stats of my dataframe? - data.describe()

Prediction target is our output, features are the variable which contribute 
in our prediction.

If we are making pan cakes, the final rating out of 10 is the prediction target 
while the ingredients used are the features.

Lets say, y = pancakes.rating
and pancake_features = ['Floor', 'BP', 'Salt', 'Sugar', 'Milk', 'Butter', 'Eggs', 'Syrup']
X = pancakes[pancake_features]

VALIDATION.

Dont use the whole data to train the model, take some rows - use it to train the Model 
(training data) and the rest to validate it (validation data)

mean absolute error = (sum|actual-predicted|)/Total number of observation

The split is based on random number generator. Supplying a numeric value to the random 
state argument gaurantees we get the same split everytime we run this script
